# Prodigy-Task-2
Task 02:  This assignment entailed completing data cleansing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I used the well-known Titanic dataset from Kaggle for this reason. The purpose was to investigate the connections between variables and uncover patterns and trends in the data.
